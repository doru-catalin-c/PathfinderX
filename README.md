<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I got the idea from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak" target="_blank">Clement's video</a> and really, I did not spend much time thinking about it. I went straight into coding. I decided not to use React for this as he did, instead I stuck with the good ol' Javascript native, ES6 to be more precise because I had to polish my skills here and there with this language. That was... one of it's purposes, though not the only one. I also had to practice Dynamic Programming and remember Data Structures so Pathfinding Algorithms proved to be a good choice to practice this. I had plenty of fun working on this project, though sometimes it drove me crazy... and it still does. 

#### Please note that this project is still a work in progress so browser and mobile compatibility is to be improved, some issues are yet to be resolved, features and other algorithms are yet to be implemented and overall user experience also will be enhanced.
